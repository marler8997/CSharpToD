
Conversion Tree
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A conversion tree is a directory that contains all the .NET projects that will
be converted "together" into D.  The root of the conversion tree is marked by
the precense of a cs2d.config file. Take the following example:
```
/workspace/cs2d.config
/workspace/ProjectA/...
/workspace/ProjectB/...
```

In this case, `/workspace` is the root of the conversion tree. This means that
cs2d will generated the converted code in `/workspace/cs2d`.

One reason for conversion trees is to aleviate the inconsistencies with .NET
namespace and D modules (See #Namespaces-To-Modules).

Namespaces To Modules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In D, all code is located within a module, and every module has a one-to-one
correspondance with the file system.

```D
// File: /sompath/org/util.d
module org.util;

// code here
```

In this example, no other file can have the module name org.util.

.NET works a little differently.  Instead of modules, it has namespacs.
Namespaces in .NET do not necessarily have any correspondance with the file
system.  Any namespace can appear in any file in any project.
```C#
namespace Org.Util
{
  // code here
}
namespace Org.Another
{
  // more code here
}
```

One of the main benefits of modules/namespaces is it allows you to reference
a symbol in another module/namespace without having to type the fully-qualified
name.  The D code generated by cs2d maintains this benefit.  Because of this,
when .NET code is translated, the code is reorganized so that all code in the
same namespace goes in the same module. The caveat is that any code that shares
a namespace, must be within the same conversion tree, so that cs2d can put them
in the same D module.

### Example
Every namespace could have a package.d file.  Inside that package.d file, it
imports all the code.  The code is distinguished by the original project it
appeared in.

```
// Suppose the namespace is System.Net
/System/Net/package.d
/System/Net/mscorelib.d // all code in the mscorlib project within the System.Net namespace.
/System/Net/System.d    // all code in the System project within the System.Net namespace.
```

Because of this, I think cs2d should have a config file in the parent tree of all
the .NET projects that it will be converting together.
```
/mycode/cs2d.config
/mycode/MyOrg/LibraryA/LibraryA.csproj // contains namespaces MyOrg and MyOrg.LibraryA
/mycode/MyOrg/LibraryB/LibraryB.csproj // contains namespaces MyOrg and MyOrg.LibraryB

// Converted Code
/mycode/cs2d/MyOrg/package.d   // public import MyOrg.LibraryA, public import MyOrd.LibraryB
/mycode/cs2d/MyOrg/LibraryA.d  // Code in LibraryA.csproj in the MyOrg namespace
/mycode/cs2d/MyOrg/LibraryB.d  // Code in LibraryB.csproj in the MyOrg namespace

/mycode/cs2d/MyOrg/LibraryA/package.d  // public import MyOrg.LibraryA.LibraryA
/mycode/cs2d/MyOrg/LibraryA/LibraryA.d // Code in LibraryA.csproj in the MyOrg.LibraryA namespace

/mycode/cs2d/MyOrg/LibraryB/package.d  // public import MyOrg.LibraryB.LibraryA
/mycode/cs2d/MyOrg/LibraryB/LibraryB.d // Code in LibraryB.csproj in the MyOrg.LibraryB namespace
```


The `internal` modifier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C# supports the `internal` modifier which makes the code visible to the current
assembly only. However, cs2d has no concept of assemblies. So cs2d treats
`internal` the same as `public`.  This should allow all converted code to work,
but may cause extra types to be visible that were not intended to be.
